# @backstage/plugin-home

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- bcf312fa52: The homepage `<Header />` is now part of the composable canvas (allowing you to add the <HomepageTimer />, for example).

  You will need to wrap your existing composed `<HomePage />` component in `<Page />`, `<Header />`, and `<Content />` components, like this:

  ```diff
  // app/src/components/home/HomePage.tsx

  + import { Content, Header, Page, HomePageTimer } from '@backstage/core-components';

  export const HomePage = () => (
  +  <Page themeId="home">
  +    <Header title="Home">
  +      <HomepageTimer />
  +    </Header>
  +    <Content>
    <Grid container spacing={3}>
      <Grid item xs={12}>
        <HomePageSearchBar />
      </Grid>
      // ...
  +    </Content>
  +  </Page>
  );
  ```
